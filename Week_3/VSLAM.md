# **Computer Vision and Visual SLAM (VSLAM)**

### üìå **Overview**

As drones increasingly operate in GPS-denied environments (indoor, urban canyons, tunnels), **Computer Vision** becomes a critical enabler of autonomy. One of the most powerful techniques for spatial awareness in such scenarios is **Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** ‚Äî where the drone builds a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously localizing itself within it using camera input.

### üéØ **Goals of VSLAM in Drones**

* Navigate autonomously without GPS
* Build 3D maps of the environment
* Avoid obstacles and re-localize after drift
* Enable high-level AI tasks (search and rescue, inspection, etc.)

## üß† 1. **What is SLAM?**

SLAM is the process of:

* **Mapping**: Creating a 2D or 3D map of the environment
* **Localization**: Determining the drone‚Äôs position within that map

**VSLAM** uses cameras (monocular, stereo, or RGB-D) to perform SLAM, often aided by IMUs for improved robustness.

## üì∑ 2. **Types of Visual SLAM in Drones**

| Type        | Description                          | Use-case                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Monocular   | Single camera                        | Lightest, but scale is ambiguous          |
| Stereo      | Two cameras (depth from disparity)   | Better scale estimation, ideal for drones |
| RGB-D       | RGB + Depth sensor (e.g., Realsense) | Dense maps, best indoors                  |
| Event-based | High-speed dynamic scenes            | FPV, racing, aggressive maneuvers         |

## üîç 3. **Core Pipeline of VSLAM**

Here's what happens step-by-step inside a VSLAM system:

1. **Image Acquisition**: Capture frames from camera(s)
2. **Feature Extraction**: Detect keypoints (e.g., ORB, FAST)
3. **Feature Matching**: Match features between frames
4. **Pose Estimation**: Estimate motion using epipolar geometry or PnP
5. **Map Update**: Triangulate landmarks and update map
6. **Loop Closure**: Recognize previously seen locations to correct drift
7. **Bundle Adjustment**: Optimize camera poses and map points globally
