## 1. Aerodynamics  
Learn the science behind what keeps aircraft in the air.

> The word comes from two Greek words: *aerios* (air) and *dynamis* (force). Aerodynamics is the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through the air.

### 📌 The Four Forces of Flight

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/forces.jpg" width="60%">
</p>

1. **Weight (Gravity)**  
   Always directed toward Earth’s center. Acts through the *center of gravity* and includes the total mass of aircraft components, fuel, and payload.

2. **Lift**  
   Opposes weight. Generated mainly by the wings as the aircraft moves through air. Acts through the *center of pressure* and depends on wing shape, size, and velocity.

3. **Drag**  
   Opposes motion through air. Depends on the shape of the aircraft, air viscosity, and speed. Acts through the *center of pressure*.

4. **Thrust**  
   Produced by engines to overcome drag. Depends on the type and configuration of propulsion systems.

### ✈️ Bernoulli’s Principle

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-47-1024x569.png" width="60%">
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Faster airflow over the curved upper surface of the wing creates lower pressure, generating lift.</b></p>

The curved top surface of a wing speeds up airflow, creating lower pressure compared to the bottom. This pressure difference results in lift.

### ✈️ Newton’s Third Law

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://kaiserscience.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/reaction-force-on-airplane-wing.gif" width="60%">
</p>
<p align="center"><b>The wings push air downward; the reaction pushes the plane upward.</b></p>

An airfoil deflects air downward (action), resulting in an upward reaction force (lift).

---

### ✈️ Angle of Attack (AOA)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PXU5_K1xioI/maxresdefault.jpg" width="60%">
</p>
<p align="center"><b>The angle between the wing and oncoming air; increasing it increases lift (to a point), but too much causes stall.</b></p>

AOA is the angle between the chord line of a wing and the relative wind. It directly affects lift and drag. Beyond a certain angle, airflow separates and the wing stalls.

<h2 align = "center">Activity 1: DropSim</h2>

DropSim considers the single **problem of an object falling under the influence of gravity and aerodynamic drag**. The user specifies a value for the weight and a value of the drag coefficient. An initial release point is given by the altitude and speed, and the code uses the standard atmosphere equations to determine a value of air density at the specified altitude. The density is used to determine the instantaneous drag on the object. The program uses the value of drag and weight to solve for the flight trajectory from Newton’s second law of motion.

## 🎯 **Mission Storyline: Operation Shadow Wing**

> **Background**:
> Tensions are rising along the border of a rugged mountainous region. Intelligence reports suggest that enemy forces are setting up a mobile command post near a disputed area. Traditional surveillance methods have been compromised due to high radar coverage and increased ground patrols.

To maintain stealth and gather critical intel, your team has been enlisted by the **Defense Research Wing (DRW)** of the Indian Armed Forces under a top-secret project codenamed **"Operation Shadow Wing."**

> **Mission**:
> You are tasked with designing a **next-generation tactical UAV** capable of penetrating enemy airspace undetected. This UAV will:

* **Scout and scan** the target area.
* **Carry a 1 kg payload** (a dummy bomb or surveillance gear).
* Transmit live video/data if possible.
* **Remain stealthy** – low radar cross-section, minimal noise.
* Operate with **speed and efficiency** to complete the mission before detection.

The success of the mission could change the course of the operation—and your UAV will be the hero of the skies.

---

## 📝 **Problem Statement**

> **Propose a mission-capable UAV system for Operation Shadow Wing.**

### 🔧 **Your UAV Must:**

1. **Type**: Be of a type of your choice (e.g., fixed-wing, VTOL, delta wing, blended body, etc.).
2. **Payload Capacity**: Carry at least **1 kg** securely, representing a dummy bomb or scanning equipment.
3. **Stealth**:

   * Minimize **acoustic signature** (noise from propulsion).
   * Reduce **visual and radar detectability** (color, materials, structure).
4. **Surveillance Capability**: Must fly stable enough to conduct **area scanning or surveillance**.
5. **Efficiency**: Maximize range and flight time with minimal power consumption.
6. **Speed**: Achieve high cruise speed to complete missions quickly and reduce loitering over dangerous zones.
7. **Launch & Recovery**: Design for practical deployment and recovery (e.g., hand launch, catapult, belly landing).

   You are allowed to necessary assumptions for the calculation.

---

## 🎨 **Deliverables**

Each team must submit a report including:

* A **brief aerodynamic and structural justification** of their airframe choice.
* Estimation of **flight performance metrics** (range, speed, endurance).
* A plan or mock-up of **payload integration**.
* Summary of **stealth features** incorporated.
* (Optional) A short **mission animation or simulation** using Gazebo or similar tools.

---

## 🧠 Bonus for Creativity:

* A **conceptual design** of the UAV (CAD sketches/drawings).
* Radar-absorbing materials
* Modular payload bay
* FPV capabilities
* Silent motor/propeller selection justification
* Camouflage based on terrain
