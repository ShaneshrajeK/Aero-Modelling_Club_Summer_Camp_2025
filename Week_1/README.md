# Week 1: How it Works?

## ðŸ§  Objective:  
Build a deep conceptual understanding of how aerial vehicles generate lift, remain stable, and maneuver in air. This week lays the groundwork by connecting physical principles with real-world drone and aircraft behavior.

## 1. Aerodynamics:
Learn the science behind what keeps aircraft in the air.

The word comes from two Greek words: aerios, concerning the air, and dynamis, which means force. Aerodynamics is the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through the air. Humans have been interested in aerodynamics and flying for thousands of years, although flying in a heavier-than-air machine has been possible only in the last hundred years.

Aerodynamics affects the motion of a large airliner, a model rocket, a beach ball thrown near the shore, or a kite flying high overhead. The curveball thrown by big league baseball pitchers gets its curve from aerodynamics.
