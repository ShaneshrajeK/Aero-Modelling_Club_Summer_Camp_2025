## 1. Aerodynamics:
Learn the science behind what keeps aircraft in the air.

The word comes from two Greek words: aerios, concerning the air, and dynamis, which means force. Aerodynamics is the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through the air. Humans have been interested in aerodynamics and flying for thousands of years, although flying in a heavier-than-air machine has been possible only in the last hundred years.

Aerodynamics affects the motion of a large airliner, a model rocket, a beach ball thrown near the shore, or a kite flying high overhead. The curveball thrown by big league baseball pitchers gets its curve from aerodynamics.

Now moving into Aerodynamics,  

### 1. The Four Forces of Flight:  

<p align = 'center'><img src="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/forces.jpg", width = "50%"></p>

  1. **Weight (Gravity):** Weight is a force that is always directed toward the center of the earth. The magnitude of the weight depends on the mass of all the airplane parts, plus the amount of fuel, plus any payload on board (people, baggage, freight, etc.). The weight is distributed throughout the airplane. But we can often think of it as collected and acting through a single point called the center of gravity. In flight, the airplane rotates about the center of gravity.
     
  2. **Lift:** To overcome the weight force, airplanes generate an opposing force called lift. Lift is generated by the motion of the airplane through the air and is an aerodynamic force. ‚ÄúAero‚Äù stands for the air, and ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù denotes motion. Lift is directed perpendicular to the flight direction. The magnitude of the lift depends on several factors including the shape, size, and velocity of the aircraft. As with weight, each part of the aircraft contributes to the aircraft lift force. Most of the lift is generated by the wings. Aircraft lift acts through a single point called the center of pressure. The center of pressure is defined just like the center of gravity, but using the pressure distribution around the body instead of the weight distribution.
     
  3. **Drag:** As the airplane moves through the air, there is another aerodynamic force present. The air resists the motion of the aircraft and the resistance force is called drag. Drag is directed along and opposed to the flight direction. Like lift, there are many factors that affect the magnitude of the drag force including the shape of the aircraft, the ‚Äústickiness‚Äù of the air, and the velocity of the aircraft. Like lift, we collect all of the individual components‚Äô drags and combine them into a single aircraft drag magnitude. And like lift, drag acts through the aircraft center of pressure.
     
  4. **Thrust:** To overcome drag, airplanes use a propulsion system to generate a force called thrust. The direction of the thrust force depends on how the engines are attached to the aircraft. In the figure shown above, two turbine engines are located under the wings, parallel to the body, with thrust acting along the body centerline. On some aircraft, such as the Harrier, the thrust direction can be varied to help the airplane take off in a very short distance. The magnitude of the thrust depends on many factors associated with the propulsion system including the type of engine, the number of engines, and the throttle setting.


### 2. Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle: 
<p align = 'center'><img src="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-47-1024x569.png", width = "50%"></p>
<p align = "center"><b>Faster airflow over the curved upper surface of the wing creates lower pressure, generating lift</b></p>

Bernoulli's principle explains how airplane wings generate lift. The curved shape of a wing forces air to travel faster over the top surface compared to the bottom surface. This increased speed over the top of the wing creates lower pressure, while the slower-moving air beneath the wing results in higher pressure. The pressure difference creates an upward force, or lift, that counteracts gravity, allowing the plane to fly.  


### 3. Newton‚Äôs Third Law:
<p align = 'center'><img src="https://kaiserscience.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/reaction-force-on-airplane-wing.gif", width = "50%"></p>
<p align = "center"><b>The wings push air downward; the reaction pushes the plane upward.</b></p>

When an airfoil, like a wing or a propeller, moves through the air, it forces the air downward (action). According to Newton‚Äôs third law, there‚Äôs an equal and opposite reaction that results in a lift, pushing the airfoil and the attached aircraft upward.

### 4. Angle of Attack:
<p align = 'center'><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PXU5_K1xioI/maxresdefault.jpg", width = "50%"></p>
<p align = "center"><b>The angle between the wing and oncoming air; increasing it increases lift (to a point), but too much causes stall.</b></p>

The angle of attack (AOA) of an aircraft is the angle between the wing's chord line and the relative wind. It's the angle at which the wing meets the incoming airflow. AOA significantly impacts an aircraft's lift, drag, and potential for stall.

<h2 align = "center">Activity 1: DropSim</h2>

DropSim considers the single **problem of an object falling under the influence of gravity and aerodynamic drag**. The user specifies a value for the weight and a value of the drag coefficient. An initial release point is given by the altitude and speed, and the code uses the standard atmosphere equations to determine a value of air density at the specified altitude. The density is used to determine the instantaneous drag on the object. The program uses the value of drag and weight to solve for the flight trajectory from Newton‚Äôs second law of motion.

## üéØ **Mission Storyline: Operation Shadow Wing**

> **Background**:
> Tensions are rising along the border of a rugged mountainous region. Intelligence reports suggest that enemy forces are setting up a mobile command post near a disputed area. Traditional surveillance methods have been compromised due to high radar coverage and increased ground patrols.

To maintain stealth and gather critical intel, your team has been enlisted by the **Defense Research Wing (DRW)** of the Indian Armed Forces under a top-secret project codenamed **"Operation Shadow Wing."**

* **Scout and scan** the target area.
* **Carry a 1 kg payload** (a dummy bomb or surveillance gear).
* Transmit live video/data if possible.
* **Remain stealthy** ‚Äì low radar cross-section, minimal noise.
* Operate with **speed and efficiency** to complete the mission before detection.

The success of the mission could change the course of the operation‚Äîand your UAV will be the hero of the skies.
