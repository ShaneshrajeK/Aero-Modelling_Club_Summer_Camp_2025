## 1. Drone Aerodynamics

Multirotor drones fly by generating lift through spinning rotors. Understanding the basics of drone aerodynamics is key to mastering UAV design and control.

### üìå The Four Forces of Drone Flight

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.droneybee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/drone-flight.jpg" width="60%">
</p>

1. **Weight (Gravity)**
   Pulls the drone toward the Earth. Acts through the center of gravity (CG). Battery, frame, motors, and payload contribute to total mass.

2. **Lift**
   Produced by spinning propellers. Each rotor generates lift by accelerating air downward. For a stable hover, total lift = weight.

3. **Thrust**
   In multirotors, thrust and lift are the same (vertical). In forward flight, a tilt causes part of the thrust vector to become horizontal, propelling the drone.

4. **Drag**
   Air resistance acting opposite to the drone‚Äôs motion. Affects forward flight and increases with speed and surface area.

### üåÄ How Multirotors Fly: The Physics

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/1/Multirotor_Control_Illustration.png" width="70%">
</p>

* Drones like quadcopters have **fixed-pitch rotors**.
* Control is achieved by **varying motor speeds**.
* Each rotor spins clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) to balance torque.

| **Motion**                    | **How It's Achieved**                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hover**                     | All rotors spin at the same speed, lift = weight.                |
| **Climb/Descend**             | Increase/decrease all rotor speeds equally.                      |
| **Pitch (Tilt Forward/Back)** | Increase rear motor speed, decrease front motor (or vice versa). |
| **Roll (Tilt Left/Right)**    | Increase right-side motors, decrease left (or vice versa).       |
| **Yaw (Turn CW/CCW)**         | Adjust opposite-pair motor speeds to create unbalanced torque.   |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Propellers and Lift Generation

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.droneybee.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/propeller-blade-pitch.jpg" width="50%">
</p>

* Propellers act like rotating airfoils.
* Lift depends on:

  * **RPM (Rotations per Minute)**
  * **Blade shape and pitch**
  * **Diameter and number of blades**
* **CW and CCW propellers** cancel out torque to avoid uncontrolled yaw.

## 6. Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR)

### Why It Matters:

* For a drone to take off, total thrust > total weight.

### üîç Calculation:

If each motor produces 1 kg thrust, and your drone weighs 1.5 kg:

* **Total Thrust = 4 kg**
* **TWR = 4 / 1.5 = 2.66**
  ‚úÖ Good TWR for stability and performance.

| **Application**    | **Recommended TWR** |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Stable Photography | \~2:1               |
| Racing / Acro      | >4:1                |
| Heavy Lift / VTOL  | >2.5:1              |

## 7. PID Tuning Basics

### üîÅ What is PID?

PID = **Proportional**, **Integral**, **Derivative**
Used in flight controllers to maintain stability.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P** | Reacts to current error (too low = slow response, too high = oscillation) |
| **I** | Reacts to accumulated error (useful for wind drift correction)            |
| **D** | Reacts to rate of error change (adds damping)                             |
